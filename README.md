## Control System Project
# An Automated Ball Balancing System using PID Control

This project demonstrates a real-time control system that stabilizes a ball on a tilting platform using a PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controller. The system uses an Arduino UNO, an ultrasonic sensor, and servo motors to detect and correct the ball's position on the platform.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:

- Maintain the ball’s position at the center of the platform.
- Apply a PID control algorithm to continuously adjust the platform's tilt.
- Demonstrate the system's real-time feedback, precision, and stability.

This is a hands-on control system project, ideal for students or engineers interested in embedded control, mechatronics, or PID tuning.
